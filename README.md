### README File for Data Processing and Clustering Pipeline

#### Project Overview

This project involves the preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering of car listings data to analyze and visualize patterns and trends in the data. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and then cluster the data using the KMeans algorithm. Finally, the results are visualized in a 2D space using Plotly.

#### Files Included
1. **`cars.csv`**: The dataset containing car listings with various features such as manufacturer, model, transmission type, color, engine specifications, and more.
2. **`Notebook 1.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code implementation for data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization.

#### Steps and Methods

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - The `cars.csv` file is loaded into a DataFrame (`df_cleaned`).
   - Missing values are handled (e.g., using imputation or removing rows with missing data).
   - Categorical columns are converted to one-hot encoded variables.

2. **One-Hot Encoding**
   - One-hot encoding is applied to categorical columns such as `manufacturer_name`, `model_name`, `transmission`, `color`, `engine_fuel`, `engine_type`, `body_type`, `state`, and `drivetrain`.
   - This process converts each categorical value into a new binary column (0 or 1), expanding the feature space.

3. **Outlier Detection and Removal**
   - Outliers are detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, Z-score method, or Isolation Forest algorithm.
   - Outliers can significantly affect the clustering and visualization results, so this step ensures cleaner and more reliable data.

4. **Standardization**
   - The features are standardized using `StandardScaler`, which scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
   - Standardization is crucial before applying UMAP and KMeans, as these algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the data.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction with UMAP**
   - UMAP is applied to the standardized data to reduce its dimensionality, making it easier to visualize.
   - UMAP parameters such as `n_neighbors` and `min_dist` are adjusted to optimize the projection.

6. **Clustering with KMeans**
   - KMeans clustering is performed on the standardized data to group the listings into distinct clusters.
   - The number of clusters (e.g., 5) is predefined, and the data points are assigned to clusters based on their proximity to the cluster centroids.

7. **Visualization**
   - The UMAP results are plotted in 2D using Plotly Express, with each point colored according to its cluster assignment.
   - This visualization helps in understanding the structure of the data and the effectiveness of the clustering.

#### How to Run the Notebook

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Ensure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries:
     - `pandas`
     - `numpy`
     - `scikit-learn`
     - `umap-learn`
     - `plotly`
     - `seaborn`

   You can install these libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn umap-learn plotly seaborn
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**
   - Open the `Notebook 1.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Run the cells sequentially to process the data, apply dimensionality reduction, perform clustering, and generate visualizations.

3. **Interpreting the Results**
   - After running the notebook, you will see a scatter plot showing the UMAP projection of the data with clusters highlighted.
   - Each cluster represents a group of similar car listings, which can provide insights into patterns in the data.

#### Important Notes

- **Handling of Missing Data**: If your dataset contains missing values, ensure to handle them appropriately before proceeding with analysis.
- **Outlier Removal**: Adjust the outlier detection parameters to suit your specific dataset and ensure that only extreme outliers are removed.
- **UMAP and KMeans Parameters**: Fine-tune the parameters for UMAP and KMeans to get the best possible results for your specific data.
